    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>This project is inspired by the Wordle game. The main goal is to learn fullstack and bring together different technologies learnt.<br></br>
                My name is Tobias Larsson and i am a student at Lernia Yrkesh√∂gskola in Sweden. 
                The project is a assignment of my education and is built as a fullstack application.  
                With the use of modern technlogies i have created a web application that allows users to play a word guessing game and get instant feedback and be able to submit their scores to a highscore list.
            </p>
            <p>Backend: Node.js for server handling, MongoDB for database storage for highscores, EJS template engine for SSR page displaying highscores. Frontend: React for modern frontend scripting and Vite to enable hmr and be a stable builder.</p>
